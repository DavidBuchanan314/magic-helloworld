# magic-helloworld
A program that prints "Hello World!" by magic, with a single memcpy.

I've only tested this with `gcc (GCC) 6.1.1 20160501`, so it probably won't work with anything else. If you don't have that exact version of GCC, you can just run the included binary.

Compile with `gcc -m32 magic.c -o magic`

The explanation of how it works is left as an exercise for the reader.
